Tasks: I built a basic HTML page and JS file.  Watched the videos.  Read through the comments on the board.  Tried to do a 'hello world' approach to build a very simple AJAX
request that grabbed text from a local file.  Once I got that to work, I had the AJAX call return the data from the git gists link.  Once that worked, I then built the JSON parsing
section and I now can successfully print a single gist on the HTML page.

Tasks:  Made it so when the checkbox is clicked the item is added to the favorites list and removed from the results list.  Additionally, I made it so if the checkbox is clicked on a favorites item, it is removed from favorites
and added back into the normal results.  I also added CSS so the results and favorites are in side by side columns.
